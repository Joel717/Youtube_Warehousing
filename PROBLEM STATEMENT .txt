PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Aim:
      The ultimate motive behind the project was to make a application which would gather analytics data from youtube using Youtube api 
  and load it into a  data lake which could be retrived for analysis when needed. 
  Streamlit, MongoDB and PostgresSQL were chosen as development tools and python was chosen as the scripting language.

Requirements:
  -The app needs to be simple and the script should be reusable.
  -The app must be able to retrive statistics of Youtube channels using Youtube Ids,even multiple channels at once. 
  -The app must be effecient enough to upload the retrieved data into MongoDB with a single button 
  -The app must be also be albe to push the datalake data into Postgres SQL for further analysis 
  -The app should also be able to fetch data from sql for easier and fundamental analysis.

Approach:
  Data Collection from YouTube:
  -Utilizes the YouTube API to retrieve channel information, playlist details, video data, and comments.
  MongoDB Storage:
  -Stores collected data in MongoDB for initial storage and easy retrieval.
  SQL Database Migration:
  -Facilitates the migration of data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL for more advanced querying.
  Streamlit App:
  -Provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for data exploration, including viewing tables and executing SQL queries.
  SQL Queries:
  -Allows users to execute SQL queries on the PostgreSQL database to gain insights from the collected data.
